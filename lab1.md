Free Culture:

The traumatic experience that Jesse Jordan faced is a failure of both 
science and policy. Punishing technological innovation is unfortunately 
common, dating back to the times of Galileo and Copernicus. Jordan's 
situation was the same; despite his contributions to social progress, he 
was robbed of all his earnings and left penniless. American society is 
known for being incredibly litigious, even in comparison with other 
Western nations. When threatened by the colossus that is the RIAA, it's 
unsurprising that he folded. The RIAA represents the antithesis of open 
source principles. Jesse endeavored to create a piece of software 
without any discriminatory intent, not distinguishing between methods of 
use. He neither aided, nor harmed pirates. He simply wished to 
contribute. Freedom to chase intellectual pursuits should remain a 
protected right of society; without it the road to stagnation and decay 
steepens.
